 ## Design

### HTML files

* `index.html`: This will be the main page of the application. It will contain the game board and the controls for the user to interact with the game.
* `game.html`: This page will be displayed when the user starts a new game. It will contain the game board and the logic for the game.
* `winner.html`: This page will be displayed when the game is over and a winner has been determined. It will display the name of the winner and a button for the user to start a new game.

### Routes

* `/`: This route will render the `index.html` page.
* `/game`: This route will render the `game.html` page.
* `/winner`: This route will render the `winner.html` page.

### CSS and JavaScript

* The application will use CSS to style the game board and the controls.
* The application will use JavaScript to implement the game logic and to handle the user's interactions with the game.

### Deployment

The application can be deployed to a web server using Flask. The following steps can be used to deploy the application:

1. Install Flask and the dependencies.
2. Create a Flask application.
3. Add the routes to the application.
4. Add the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the application.
5. Configure the web server to serve the application.
6. Start the web server.

Once the application is deployed, users can access it by visiting the URL of the web server.
